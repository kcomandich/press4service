   		    <p>Do you own or manage a restaurant or bar? Want to make your customers happier and earn more money? Then you might be interested in <i>press4service</i>. It's a system that lets your customers push a button to instantly request service from your wait staff, anywhere at your facility. Why is this a good thing?</p>
   		    <ul>
                <li><strong>Boosts customer satisfaction:</strong> Customers don't have to sit around, hoping that a waiter comes around. The <i>press4service</i> system gives customers the power to order items and request bills when they're ready. Happier customers will buy more and return with their friends. </li>
   		        <li><strong>Increases table turnover rate:</strong> During the lunch rush, you want to serve customers quickly and get them out the door so you can serve the next ones. The <i>press4service</i> system cuts wait times so you can serve more customers in the same amount of time. </li>
   		        <li><strong>Gets more  orders:</strong> Side-dishes, additional drinks and deserts are big money-makers, but patrons in a rush don't order as many of these extras as they could because they're worried about getting back to work. The <i>press4service</i> system reduces the time crunch so that patrons can order everything they want. </li>
   		        <li><strong>More profit:</strong> When you serve more orders and customers with better efficiency during peak hours, you earn more.</li>
   		        <li><strong>Bigger tips for your wait staff:</strong> Happy customers give bigger tips and will treat your staff better. </li>
	        </ul>
   		    <p>The <i>press4service</i> system is not a substitute for an adequate and well-trained wait staff. This technology isn't for cutting costs -- it's about providing excellent service to make the bar and dining experience more enjoyable for everyone. </p>
